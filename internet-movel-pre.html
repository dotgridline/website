			<p>Minha Internet Pré was the biggest and most complex project I have ever worked in my life. The objective of the project was to help the process of activating a pre-paid chip for mobile internet on tablets or notebooks/desktops(using modems) because the natural process for activation requires a call to a specific number and since the user is not using a smartphone, it isn't good to force him to use other gadget to complete the registration.</p>

			<p>The service we built was responsible for identifying the chip, registering it inside the telecommunication company and them showing the mobile usage information in a clear way for the user.</p>

			<p>What makes this project so big and unique is the fact that for the user, the service has only 4 pages <span class="highlight">Welcome</span>, <span class="highlight">Registration</span>, <span class="highlight">Daily Access</span> and <span class="highlight">Help</span> – but the Daily Access had more than 40 integrations between the telecommunication company and us, that the user cannot see.</p>

			<p><span class="highlight">The Daily Access</span> page is the only one that really matters for the user and is where the magic happens. Every first access of the day, he is redirected it, where he can find information about the amount of data left in his Wi-Fi/3G package, the amount of money he available to buy a new package, and the option to buy a new package or recharge his account, at anytime.</p>
