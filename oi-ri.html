			<p>Oi Ri was a project created for the investors of Oi, one of the biggest telecommunication companies of Brazil. Our idea and objective with the app was to give the same information available on the website but with a richer and more interactive interface. We wanted the user to have access to all the documents on the website, the possibility to open and save downloads as favorites for offline access and a specific area that the user could see in real time the share prices of the company.</p>
