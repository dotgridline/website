			<p>Coffee Break was a project made at the fourth semester of university and the theme for this year's project was defined as coffee, with freedom to explore the media used. Instead of following the traditional path of telling the history of coffee in Brazil as most of the students did, we wanted to connect people that are crazy about coffee. Many workers have a close relation with coffee as a way to keep them awake or productive, like: Designers, developers, teachers or scientists. More than this, these people usually take it a little more serious than just drink coffee, they enjoy the experience, the different tastes and ways of making a good coffee, so why not create a community where they could share information about it?</p>

			<p>That's why we came up with Coffee Break, a mix of social network and forum for those who love coffee. The idea of the project was to connect people so they could talk and share information about types of coffee, how-to about the many different methods for making coffee, coffee machines and much more.</p>

			<p>This project was not developed, it was just a concept with a interactive mockup, mostly because it was on the beginning of the university. Anyway, it was a coffee social network made by a coffee lover, so everything was well planned.</p>
