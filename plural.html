	<h4>What's this?</h4>
	<p>Plural was my final project at university. It was done in one year and a half and had the subject of <span class="highlight">usability</span>, ubiquity and the <span class="highlight">evolution of the Multi-touch technology.</span></p>
	
	<h4>What's the idea behind it?</h4>
	<p>The idea of Plural was to be a system developed for collaboration between multiple users, in a multi-touch tabletop, using technologies like NFC and Cloud computing to improve workflows and allow a ubiquitous use of technology.</p>
	
	<h4>The Design process</h4>
	<p>It was <span class="highlight">developed by me from the ground</span>, starting with the information architecture of the system, and them going to <span class="highlight">tests with users</span> for testing the <span class="highlight">usability of the system</span>. After several tests, problems and solutions, i came up with a system, visually inspired in a flat, minimal design, that allowed <span class="highlight">fast interactions</span>, with lot of <span class="highlight">touch gestures</span> and <span class="highlight">simultaneous interaction between users.</span></p>
	
	<h4>How it would work</h4>
	<p>When the user enters the "meeting room", his cell phone will <span class="highlight">connect via NFC</span> to the Tabletop, and using the <span class="highlight">Wi-Fi</span> of the room, it will sync every project the user wanted to use as a base for the collaboration. Then, all the users could use the built-in tools to <span class="highlight">create –– and</span> modificate everything they could do with pens , papers and much more. Then, the "mutual" work could be easily <span class="highlight">shared via NFC and Wi-Fi</span> to the other phones in the room.</p>
	
	<h4>What makes this project so special?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>It was all developed from the ground with <span class="highlight">one clear objective</span>: Study to improve the Touch "language".</li>
		<li>It is <span class="highlight">focused in creation of content</span> – Touch technology is much more focused in consuming and not in creating content.</li>
		<li>The <span class="highlight">technologies used</span> and the concepts made using future technologies to make it portable, just like a sheet of paper.</li>
		<li>Based on the concepts of <span class="highlight">Natural User Interface(NUI)</span> to make it easy and intuitive.</li>
		<li>It's <span class="highlight">ubiquitous</span>, It's the <span class="highlight">future</span>.</li>
	</ul>
