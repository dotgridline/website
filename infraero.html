			<p>This captive portal was the first one we did at Mobicare. We developed two versions of the website, one for mobile and one for desktop, mostly because of the range of cellphones(including non-smartphones) and desktop browsers we had to fullfill, so it is totally cross-browser and cross-platform, ranging from ie6 to modern browsers and from 2006's mid-phones to the latest androids and iPhones.</p>
			<p>This website is only accessible inside the airports and if the user completes a registration before. The registration is free and everytime the user connects, the website asks for a valid boarding pass and passport. </p>
