			<p>Ative was a project made at the fifth semester of university and can be translated as Active. The theme of this project was health and sedentary lifestyle, and the website was made for people who wanted to do exercises but had no money, knowledge or no companionship.</p>

			<p>Ative is a social network prototype that had the idea of using users who already do exercises or groups who are open to new participants, as a way to encourage and stimulate those who have a sedentary lifestyle, because it has been proven that meeting new people and having a group, encourages who is trying to achieve an objective. Each user and each group had their own profile and the information was primarily made online, where sedentary people usually feel more comfortable.</p>
