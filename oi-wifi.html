			<p>This app was made for <a href="http://www.oi.com.br/oi/oi-pra-voce/internet/servicos/rede-oi-wifi">Oi</a>, one of the biggest telecommunication companies in the country, but their work with wi-fi is much greater than that. They have made a partnership with <a href="http://signupvex.com/">Vex</a> and <a href="http://corp.fon.com/">Fon</a> , to make a big and complete Wi-fi network all over the world. Their network have more than 200000 access points only in Brazil and this number is increasing everyday, with almost 20000000 hotspots around the world.</p>

			<p>This app was made only for Android tablets because of the freedom the developers have to manage the user wireless connection. After installing the app, the user fill in his login information and from now on, the app is responsible for disconnecting the user mobile data and connecting to any wi-fi hotspost certificated by the company. When the user loses the Wi-fi signal, the app automatically reconnects to the user mobile data. At anytime the user can search in a list or in the map for the closest Access Point, even if he is offline, because the app can create a mini database of hotspots.</p>

			<p>This was my first app for tablets and it was the first app that the company had done using the new android interface, known as Holo. It was really easy and really good to be the designer leader of this project cause it matches my visual style of interfaces, pretty clean and minimalistic.</p>
