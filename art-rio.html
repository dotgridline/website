			<p>This project was a surprise for the team itself because the project started and ended in 2 days. The Design team was notified 2 days before the event, so it was basically one day to think and sketch a layout, and one day to code. It was my first time as a project leader, as an all-in-one(designer+front-end) and the first responsive website we ever made at Mobicare, where I worked by the time.</p>

			<p>For the user, the website was really simple. It was just one screen, where the user could know more about the exhibition and the service of Wi-Fi or click on the button "Connect", to have unlimited access to the internet. The Internet was free but it required on the first access, an authentication that was only recognized if the user entered the captive portal and clicked on the button.</p>
